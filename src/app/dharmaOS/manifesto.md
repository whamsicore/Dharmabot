# Dharma Manifesto
- Fun is more important than speed, and speed more than scalability!
- Our goal is to infuse intelligence into every facet of the app.
- The application itself should take on an identity, to become in many ways, its own master of evolution. This begins with self-awareness...
- True growth begins with self-awareness, therefore self-awareness is key.
